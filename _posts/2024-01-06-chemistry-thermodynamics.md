In chemistry, the energy change of a system in a calorimeter can be modeled in more than one way. The common method is to label it -q<sub>metal</sub>=q<sub>water</sub> where the both the heat variables are q=constant x (T<sub>final</sub>-T<sub>initial</sub>). This leads to a consistent use of q in equations as long as it is remembered that one item side is negative.

Another method is to use q<sub>metal</sub>=q<sub>water</sub> where one side is q=constant x (T<sub>final</sub>-T<sub>initial</sub>) and the other is q=constant x (T<sub>initial</sub>-T<sub>final</sub>). This method relies on the side that is lower in temperature and increasing in temperature to be be (T<sub>final</sub>-T<sub>initial</sub>). The side higher in temperature and decreasing is the opposite with (T<sub>initial</sub>-T<sub>final</sub>).

It doesn't matter which method is used as they are mathematically equivalent to each other.
